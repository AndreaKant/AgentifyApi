# AgentifyApi: A Hybrid and Agnostic AI Agent

A state-of-the-art hybrid AI agent built on a decoupled microservices architecture. It leverages a two-tier thinking process: a **Strategic Planner** for high-level goal setting and a **Task Operator** for execution. The agent dynamically discovers and interacts with tools (REST, gRPC, GraphQL) through semantic search on a vector database, and features a **Recovery Agent** to autonomously handle and learn from API errors. The entire system is orchestrated via Docker Compose, creating a scalable and resilient framework for building autonomous solutions.

---

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

The system is composed of several Docker microservices that work in concert to provide a centralized intelligence. The flow is designed for resilience, adaptability, and observability.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **üß† Hybrid Agent Architecture:** Utilizes a high-level **Planner** (using powerful models like Gemini Pro) to create strategic plans, and a low-level **Operator** (using faster, cheaper models like Gemini Flash) to execute each step, optimizing for both cost and performance.
-   **üîå Agnostic Tool Integration:** The agent is not hardcoded to specific tools. An `Indexer` service automatically parses API contracts (OpenAPI for REST, `.proto` for gRPC, and GraphQL schemas) and indexes them in a `pgvector` database, allowing for dynamic, semantic discovery of the best tool for any given task.
-   **‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π Self-Healing & Resilience:** A dedicated `Recovery Agent` intercepts failed API calls. It uses an LLM to analyze the error, reason about the cause (e.g., invalid payload, temporary server issue), and autonomously decide on a recovery strategy, such as retrying with a corrected payload or waiting.
-   **üèõÔ∏è Decoupled Microservices:** Built with Docker Compose, the system isolates every component‚Äîfrom the agent's core logic to the LLM gateway and API parsers‚Äîinto its own container. This ensures scalability, maintainability, and easy development.
-   ** GATEWAY Centralized LLM Gateway:** A dedicated Node.js microservice proxies all calls to external LLMs. This central point manages API keys, implements robust retry/fallback logic, and provides centralized logging, abstracting away complexity from the main agent.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git
- An OpenAI API key and a Google AI Studio (Gemini) API key.

### Installation
1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AndreaKant/AgentifyApi
    ```
2.  Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd AgentifyApi
    ```
3.  Create your environment file from the example:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
4.  Open the `.env` file and insert your API keys.

5.  Build and run all services in the background:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```
6.  Run the indexer to populate the database with the available tools:
    ```bash
    docker-compose exec indexer python -m indexer.main
    ```

## üéÆ How to Use

To start a conversation with the agent, run the following command:
```bash
docker-compose exec agent python -m agent.main
```

At this point, the agent will greet you, and you can start asking questions. For example: 
```What is the heaviest Pok√©mon between Pikachu, Charizard, and Snorlax?```
